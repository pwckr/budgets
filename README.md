# Budgets
Python-project for "Advanced Software Engineering" (WS 23/24) which serves user as budget tracking app. Users can define their monthly budget and save each expense, allowing them to keep track of their finances.

## Software Engineering
### 1. Git
See commit history [here](https://github.com/pwckr/budgets/commits/main/).

Task description:

(Document usage and understanding of Git)
### 2. UML
Task description:

(At least 3 good different diagrams (PNGs or similiar). "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD.)
### 3. Domain Driven Design
Task can be found [here](https://github.com/pwckr/budgets/tree/main/DDD)

Task description:

(If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with >4 Domains coming from an Event Storming. Drop your Domains into a Core Domain Chart and indicate the Relations between the Domains!)
### 4. Metrics
Task description:

(At least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.)
### 5. Clean Code Development
Points addressed:
- Explanatory variable names
- Docstrings
- Parameter- and return-types
- Each unit-test has one assert-statement


Task description:

-  At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved
- 10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet (PDF).
### 6. Build
Task description:

(Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) => to be merged with 7!)
### 7. Continious Delivery
Task description:

(Show me your pipeline using e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc. E.g. you can also use Jenkins Pipelining or BlueOcean, etc. But at least insert more than 2 script calls as done in the lecture! (e.g. also call Ant or Gradle or something else).)
### 8. Unit Tests
Task description:

(Integrate some nice unit tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build)
### 9. IDE
Task description:

(Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!)
### 10. DSL
Task description:

(Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project (hence it can also be in another language).)
### 11. Functional Programming
Task description:

Prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
- only final data structures
- (mostly) side-effect-free functions
- the use of higher-order functions
- functions as parameters and return values
- use closures / anonymous functions
- You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.
