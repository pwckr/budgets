# Clean Code Cheat Sheet
- Use type annotations for parameters, variables and returns, use docstrings; all compliant with PEP8/PEP257
- Formatting: For code, use [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), for docstrings [PEP257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for Docstrings.
- Names: Take time when choosing function- and variable-names. Names should render most comments redundant
- Comments: Use comments as sparse as possible by adhering to the previous point! Only use them when something is really not obvious!
- Write functions that only do one thing to enable high reusability and minimize redundancy!
